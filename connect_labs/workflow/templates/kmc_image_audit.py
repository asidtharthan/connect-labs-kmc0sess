KMC Image Audit — cross-LLO scale-photo audit with per-opportunity AI routing.

Why this template exists
------------------------
KMC's existing options each fall short in a specific way:

* ``bulk_image_audit`` (wf 5113) works, but its AI agent list is hardcoded, it has no
  sampling controls, and one agent applies to the whole run — which is wrong for KMC
  because scale hardware differs by LLO.
* ``weekly_dual_track_audit`` has the better operating model (census one image type,
  sample the rest, run on a schedule) but its template lives outside this repo and its
  classifier registry has no analog-dial entry, so it cannot serve EHA/BERI/NAMA.

The deciding constraint is hardware: PIPN uses digital scales, EHA/BERI/NAMA use analog
dials, and *within program 46 both appear side by side*. So the agent has to be chosen
per opportunity, not per run. That is this template's core idea, and the reason it fans
out one single-opportunity audit per selected opp rather than one audit for all of them.

Design notes worth knowing before editing
-----------------------------------------
* **Per-opp fan-out is deliberate.** Setting ``opportunity_ids`` and relying on the
  backend's multi-opp routing produced zero sessions for every non-home opportunity when
  it was tried on wf 5113. Firing one single-opp ``createAudit`` per opportunity — the
  pattern the KMC dashboard already uses in production — works. Keep it.
* **Sessions are stored scoped per opportunity**, so the results fetch loops the opp set
  and merges. Fetching ``/sessions/`` without ``?opportunity_id=`` only ever returns the
  home opp's sessions, which reads as "0 sessions" for everything else.
* **Image extraction differs between this repo and the deployed backend.** The copy of
  ``_filter_visits_by_related_fields`` in this repo filters *visits* and returns every image
  on a matched visit — running it locally against opp 1487 produced four question types and
  161 of 308 images (52%) with no reading. The DEPLOYED backend also narrows to the
  requested image path: live run 13250 extracted 858 images across 6 opportunities, all of
  them ``anthropometric/upload_weight_image`` and all 858 carrying a reading. The repo is
  behind. The "images without a reading" warning is kept as a guard — it simply does not
  fire on the deployed path — and must not be removed on the assumption that it is dead.
* **There is no per-image-type sampling and no FLW cap.** ``AuditCriteria`` accepts only
  ``sample_percentage`` for a date-range audit (``count_per_flw`` applies solely to
  ``last_n_per_flw``, and ``max_flws`` does not exist — passing it is silently ignored).
  An earlier draft of this template exposed both; they were removed rather than shipped
  as controls that quietly do nothing.

# are registration forms carrying no photo at this path at all (40%), so a cap of 20 could
# yield anywhere from 20 photos down to zero depending on submission order.

# pushed into SQL — which makes it the cheap, window-size-independent way to make the cap
# mean photos rather than visits.

    // agent on NAMA's dial photos previously returned 0 pass / 18 fail), so a real match rate from
    // the other agent is the tell. Only the non-default agent is run — half the classifier calls,
    // and less exposed to the timeouts that are currently costing digital two calls in three.

    // service failing, not evidence about the hardware, and counting it as a non-match would let a
    // bad afternoon on the classifier silently "prove" the wrong answer. Too few real verdicts and
